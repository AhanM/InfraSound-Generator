# InfraSound-Generator
A User Interface that produces a Sine Wave of the specified Frequency.

Made especially for the purpose of a Research Project which is about the use of
infrasonic sound to prevent train collisions with elephants.   

The program takes temprature as input and alters the frequency so that the change
in velocity of sound is accomodated. It also takes the velocity of the user as input
so that doppler effect may be negated.

The Project is co-authored by me and Prabhav Chawla.
